9 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Inventorying an archive remains a challenge. Obstacles of all types and sizes that stand in the way of sorting and describing the archive documents often lead archivists to present their approach and results for approval by their peers. This inventory too is no exception to this unwritten rule and would not have been finalized without the help of a number of colleagues. First, I would like to sincerely thank PhD Pierre-Alain Tallier, PhD Michaël Amara and PhD Michel Van der Eycken for the proofreading of and the corrections to the present inventory. Colleague Geert Leloup also was of much assistance as I could discuss my findings with him and rely on his expertise. I also thank our collaborator Pascale Bataille for her help in packaging and numbering parts of the archive. Acknowledgements also go to Advanced Master student Merijn Peeters for the useful bibliographical references he handed me during his traineeship at the National Archives of Belgium. Finally, I would like to express particular thanks to Mr. Bart Eeman, public officer at the Mission Restitution Cultural Goods (Cel Recuperatie van Geroofde Goederen/Cellule de récupération des biens spoliés) under the authority of the FPS Economy, SMEs, Self-Employed and Energy (FOD Economie, KMO, Middenstand en Energie/SPF Economie, PME, Classes moyennes et Energie) who assisted me in coordinating the transfer and valorisation of the archive about looted artworks.

Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   122. HISTORY The German invasion of Belgium on 10 May 1940 disrupted the economic life and goods traffic. Numerous belongings, ranging from cargo to luggage containing private property, were abandoned or lost in the turmoil of war. The huge amount of requests for restitution addressed to the Belgian government in exile in Poitiers led to the enactment of the decree-law of 3 July 1940 stipulating the creation of a Department for Identification and Liquidation of abandoned Belgian Goods (Dienst voor Identificering en Vereffening van onbeheerde Belgische goederen/Office d’Identification et de Liquidation des Marchandises belges spoliées). The department returned home to Brussels in July 1940 together with a stream of fellow countrymen who had fled the war. On 31 March 1941, the secretaries-general set up a new Department for Identification and Liquidation of abandoned Belgian goods belonging to Belgian Natural or Legal Persons (Dienst voor Identificering en Vereffening van Verdwenen en Onbeheerde Belgische Goederen Toebehorende aan Belgische Natuurlijke of Rechtspersonen (DIV)/Office d’Identification et de Liquidation des Marchandises belges spoliées appartenant à des personnes morales ou de droit belges (OIL)) that tacitly took over the competences of its exiled predecessor. With the occupation progressing, the competences of the DIV/OIL were extended. On 16 November 1944, shortly after the liberation of the Belgian national territory, the Department for Economic Recovery (DER) was set up, taking over the duties of the Department for Identification and Liquidation. The DER was the sole Belgian office responsible for tracing, recovering and liquidating lost movable goods of Belgian private or public possession in Belgium or abroad during the Second World War. In early 1945, the DER was also assigned with the tracing of enemy military equipment. By virtue of the final agreement of the Paris Peace Conference, the DER became responsible for war reparations by means of industrial compensations in kind. Beside these economic activities, the DER also had a culture office commissioned to identify and restitute stolen works of art. In the course of the 1950s, the restitution policy slowly but surely lost importance compared to the expanding economic tasks of the DER. The DER would not only work to support the Belgian coal and flax industries, it also played a role in foreign trade relations and was entrusted with certain tasks within the framework of the science policy, in particular the Belgian participation in the European space programme. In the 1960s, the economic emphasis of the duties of the DER led to a review of the department’s statutes. For this purpose, the DER was dissolved by the Royal Decree of 10 November 1967 and its services were merged with the Commercial Office for Provisioning (Handelsdienst voor Ravitaillering (HDR)/Office Commercial du Ravitaillement (OCRA)) to form a new body, the Belgian Office for Economy and Agriculture (Belgische Dienst voor Bedrijfsleven en Landbouw (BDBL)/Office belge de l'Economie et de l'Agriculture (OBEA)). 3. COMPETENCES AND ACTIVITIES a. Department for Identification and Liquidation (DIV/OIL) Upon its creation on 3 June 1940, the DIV/OIL’s mission was defined as “the administration and liquidation of commodities or movable goods that belong to Belgian natural or legal persons and that have partly or entirely been destroyed, gotten lost, or diverted from their initial purpose in Belgium or abroad by a cause related to the state of war Europe endures 




Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   13since 1 September 1939”.1 When drafting this mission statement, the legislator clearly had the national interests in mind. The fact that the DIV/OIL was able to substitute itself for the former owner(s) for the recovery of the goods underlines the collective undertone of its action. The return to Brussels in July 1940 caused the Department to operate under significantly different circumstances. The position of the DIV/OIL was weak, not only in France, but also in Belgium as the body was not officially recognized by the secretaries-general and the German occupying power.2 Fresh impetus was given to the Department on 31 March 1941, when its competences were adapted to the situation: the DIV/OIL received the mission to “trace the goods that belong to or are intended for Belgian nationals or businesses and that got lost during transport in Belgium or abroad or were diverted from their initial purpose”. Compared to the version of June 1940, the emphasis lay on the recovery of private goods and belongings that were alienated during transport. By extension, the DIV/OIL had to “identify the recovered goods by tracking down their owners and entitled persons” and to take all necessary measures for the preservation of not yet identified goods. Finally, the DIV/OIL had to help owners and entitled persons in recovering their goods or provide assistance for obtaining compensation, if the DIV/OIL was rightfully mandated by the concerned owners or entitled persons to do so.3 The decree of 10 March 1942 further expanded the competences mentioned above. Indeed, from this moment on, the DIV/OIL was also able to negotiate with foreign powers on behalf of clients or owners of lost commodities in order to defend Belgian interests. The DIV/OIL had to collect all compensations resulting from negotiations before handing them over to the entitled persons. Finally, the legislator also underlined that the DIV/OIL was authorised to accept and fulfil all mandates related to its missions and entrusted to it by Belgian or foreign natural or legal persons.4 The decree of 1 May 1944 brought one last addition to the tasks of the DIV/OIL. Henceforth, the Department was also entitled – under certain circumstances – to establish and appraise damage to commodities and movable goods: 1. damages by plundering or destruction resulting from the violence of war, if an aggrieved party had filed a complaint before a criminal court; 2. damages resulting from loss, destruction or damage of cargo, commodities or rolling stock present on the Belgian railway network between 9 and 31 May 1940.5 b. Department for Economic Recovery The necessity to set up the DER was initially brought about by the continuation of the competences exercised by the DIV/OIL during the occupation. Immediately after the liberation of the Belgian territory, the legislator understood that “in order to protect the economic and financial interests of the country, it is absolutely essential and urgent to set up a department commissioned to trace, identify, preserve and possibly have at its disposal abandoned movable goods and commodities that are of most urgent necessity to the country’s

The name of the department was shortened by this decree to “Department for Identification and Liquidation of Belgian Goods”. 5 Decree of 1 May 1944 complementing and amending the decree of 15 March 1941 (Belgian Official Jounral, 02/06/1944). 




Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   14economy”.6 In the beginning, the “mission statement” of the Department for Economic Recovery thus largely looked like a synthesis of the competences exercised by the former DIV/OIL, when the Department was assigned in late 1944 with “1. tracing both in Belgium and abroad the commodities and goods that were abandoned, partially or entirely destroyed or lost; 2. investigating what had happened to these commodities or movable goods; 3. identifying the recovered commodities or movable goods by finding back their owners or entitled persons; 4. ensuring that all necessary preservation measures are taken by third parties; 5. helping the owners or entitled persons to recover their commodities or movable goods; to liquidate them; […] and to receive compensation for the reclaim of these goods; to take the necessary steps in order to obtain payback for their value; 6. providing assistance to the competent Belgian authorities in the negotiations with foreign authorities […] in order to conclude agreements about the commodities and movable goods mentioned above; 7. determining, if necessary, the form in which requests regarding the [aforementioned] goods must be addressed; 8. exercising the mandates conferred to it by natural or legal persons of Belgian or foreign nationality forasmuch as they are accepted by the Department, pertain to its field of activity and bear on commodities or movable goods; 9. reassigning owners with the property of their commodities or movable goods in the state in which they presently are […]; 10. possibly administrating these goods according to the instructions of the Ministry for Economic Affairs”.7 Within this context, the DER was obliged to indicate to the Sequestration Office all properties falling under the competence of the latter. The legislator was even of the opinion that the work of the DER would simplify the tasks of, among others, the Sequestration Office.8 In the years to follow, the competences of the DER would progressively be expanded. The decree-law of 16 January 1945 tasked the DER to trace enemy military equipment. For this purpose, the DER had to set up a general inventory of enemy war equipment present in Belgian storage locations, in Allied storage facilities or elsewhere in Belgium. Then, the DER had to find out the legal status of this equipment and to centralize the claims by individuals or associations regarding equipment that had wrongfully been considered as spoils of war. Finally, after consultation with the allied authorities or other competent bodies, the DER could handle requests for unblocking parts of the spoils of war for the benefit of the Belgian trade and industry.9 The role of the DER in the Belgian economy significantly changed due to the decree-law of 16 December 1946: in addition to its “traditional” competences regarding recovery, the Department also got charged for the first time with tasks related to the coordination of reparations and trade interests. After the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences in 1945, the final agreement of the Paris Peace Conference signed on 14 January 1946 fixed the distribution of the war reparations to be paid by Germany to the Western Allied powers. Under the auspices of the Minister for Economic Affairs, the DER was entrusted with receiving all objects, goods, commodities and sums of money that Belgium would receive as reparation for war damage. To that end, the DER had to take care of the collection of these goods in Germany and their subsequent transport to Belgium, where the Domains Administration (Bestuur der                                                 

 6 Report to the Regent, annexed to the decree-law of 16 November 1944 about the creation of a Department for Economic Recovery (Belgian Official Journal, 22/11/1944). The report to the Regent also mentions that the existing decrees (from the war period) would be consolidated in a single pertinent legislative text in the course of the creation of a new administration for the recovery of lost goods. 7 Decree-law of 16 November 1944, Art. 2 (Belgian Official Journal, 22/11/1944). 8 Ibid., Art. 3. 9 Decree-law of 16 January 1945 expanding the scope of work of the Department for Economuc Recovery (Belgian Official Journal, 18/01/1945).

Secondly, the DER was instructed to “conclude all contracts regarding the purchase of goods or commodities in Germany with the Allies as well as with individuals with a view to importing them to Belgium, as well as the purchase of goods and commodities in Belgium for export to Germany”.10 In anticipation of the resumption of normal business relations with West Germany, the DER was, in other words, in charge of concluding every import and export contract with this country. In addition to this substantial expansion of the DER’s tasks, the decree-law of December 1946 held another clause that would more and more determine the work of the Department from the middle of the 1950s. According to this addendum, the DER was ordered to “carry out every other mission entrusted to it, being covered by and in execution of the instructions given to it by the Minister for Economic Affairs”.11 Of course, this stipulation was adopted in the revision of the statutes of the DER in 1956, when it became ever clearer that the missions carried out within the framework of the immediate post-war recovery were as good as finished or at least “put on the back burner”.12 In practice, the DER – now officially labelled a “parastatal” institution of category B – played a key role in re-equipping the coalmines and supporting the Belgian flax industry, the trade relations with East Germany and the science policy of the state. The continuing importance of the DER would not prevent the Department from being shut down by the Royal Decree of 10 November 1967 and merging with the Commercial Office for Provisioning to form a new entity called “Belgian Office for Economy and Agriculture” (BDBL/OBEA). The legislator praised the flexibility of both agencies that “act in times of peace with due hastiness and diligence in order to back the economic and scientific policy of the government”.13 It was nevertheless deemed necessary to “be able to rationalize the different tasks of these agencies” by merging their missions and conferring the supervision thereof to both the Minister for Economic Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture. The tasks of the legal successor of both agencies reflects the role played by the DER and the Commercial Office for Provisioning within the Belgian economy: the Belgian Office for Economy and Agriculture was not only active in the sector of farming products (in particular with regard to the implementation of European directives and regulations on market organisation) and the different trading sectors (mainly with respect to the country’s provisioning and the stabilisation of the markets), it was also entrusted with missions pertaining to the science policy of the state, to the negotiations with foreign authorities about, among others, war reparations, restitution of goods, tokens and compensation payments, as well as trade actions for provisioning and agriculture.14

Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   164. ORGANISATION a. Department for Identification and Liquidation Initially, a governing committee composed of a chairman and five to seven members took care of the DIV/OIL’s daily management. The committee was appointed for a renewable one-year mandate by the head of the Ministry for Economic Affairs. Within the legal framework and the statutes of the Department, this governing committee had the most extensive management powers.15 The decree of 10 March 1942 modified the composition of the committee: from now on, it was composed of 12 to 15 members including, by legal disposition, two delegates of the Ministry for Economic Affairs, one delegate of the Ministry of Finance, one delegate of the Ministry of the Interior and Public Health, one delegate of the Ministry for Work and Social Security and the Commissariat-General for the country’s reconstruction, one delegate of the Ministry of Transport and finally, one delegate of the Office for the Works of the Demobilised Army. The other members held a renewable one-year mandate. Every three months, the committee had to file proceedings to the head of the Ministry for Economic Affairs. After the modification mentioned above, daily management of the Department and the execution of its decisions could be commissioned to a Director-General who represented the DIV/OIL in all private, judicial or public actions.16 The DIV/OIL had several branch offices in Belgium and abroad for tracing and identifying movable goods and commodities. In addition to the head office in Brussels, the DIV/OIL also had regional offices in Ghent, Antwerp, Liège and Charleroi, in France (Paris, Clermont-Ferrand, Bordeaux, La Pallice and Marseille) and in Tunis. As there is no official organisation chart, it is particularly difficult to draw the internal organisational structure with the regional offices and the head office, even more so as the preserved archive documents do not bear any trace of the organisation structure. However, the first ten-year report of the DER may help shedding some light on how the DIV/OIL functioned. The head office in Brussels was probably subdivided in a number of services in charge of tracing different types of goods or commodities: said work report mentions a department for wagon loads, one department for bicycles and one department for cargo on steamers and barges.17 It is also certain that on 15 March 1943, a “service for establishing and appraising damage” was added to the DIV/OIL.18 Initially, the DIV/OIL had no fixed budget allocated by the competent authority. As a consequence, the Department had to earn revenues from charges raised on those who addressed it. These charges could amount to a maximum of 5% of the value of the recovered goods, but the DIV/OIL was entitled to withhold the goods until the amount due was fully paid.19 It was not until the decree of 10 March 1942 that a credit was allocated from the budget of the Ministry for Economic Affairs as an advance on the working capital. The other financial means the DIV/OIL had at its disposal for its missions had to be deposited at the National Bank of Belgium and the postal cheque office. Henceforth, the DIV/OIL would annually issue a profit and loss statement in addition to its assets and liabilities.20

Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   17b. Department for Economic Recovery The organisational structure of the DER was largely based on the DIV/OIL structure. The former governmental committee was replaced by a management board composed of 5 to 7 members among which one vice chairman and one chairman. Within the legal framework set up by the statutes in November 1944, this board had the most extensive competences regarding everyday management of the Department and current affairs. The management board could appoint agents and personnel of the DER and determine the statutes. The Director-General carried out day-to-day management of the DER, supervised the different offices and served as rapporteur of the management board meetings. A government commissioner appointed by the Ministry for Economic Affairs supervised the general management of the DER and also partook in the meetings of the management board with an advisory vote.21 The decree-law of 16 December 1946 significantly extending the competences of the DER also changed the structure of the management board: henceforth, the board needed to have at least 9 members including respectively one delegate of the Prime Minister, of the Minister for Economic Affairs, of the Minister for Finance, of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, of the Minister for the Re-equipment of the Country and of the Sequestration Office.22 The laws of March 1956 regarding the statutes of the DER did not bring about significant changes. The internal organisation of the services within the DER constantly underwent changes (see the three annexed organisation charts on p. 29-31). Three main periods can be distinguished: at first, the DER was split up in a series of “administrative services” among which a legal office, a secretariat and various services coordinating the missions abroad (in particular to Germany) on the one hand, and a number of directorates representative of the main missions of the DER in the immediate post-war period on the other hand: military equipment, restitutions, trade and reparations. From 1954 on, the organisation chart of the DER was progressively simplified and made clearer: the Department was reduced to a secretariat, a bookkeeping office, a Restitutions directorate and a Government operations directorate set up in 1953. However, the DER did not reach a point of saturation yet: the economic missions it was entrusted with led to a new branching out of its services from 1959 onwards. In 1960, the DER was composed of administrative services (secretariat, bookkeeping and supplies [Dutch: economaat/French: économat]) and two new directorates in which all other (technical) services were combined. The exact distinction between the two directorates is not very clear, but it is certain that the second directorate became the more predominant one over time: it comprised the offices for freightage, re-equipment of the coal mines, aids to the textile industry, foreign trade relations and participation in the space programme of the European Launch Development Organisation (ELDO) and the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO). It seems that the first directorate mainly centralised a number of “remaining competences” regarding goods recovery. To cover its operational costs, the DER was granted a credit from the budget of the Ministry for Economic Affairs. If necessary, provisional twelfths could be allocated as advance money and deposited on the account of the DER. The expansion of the DER’s competences in late 1946 also led to an additional annual allowance by the Ministry in order to cover the commercial activities it was now charged with. Finally, an auditor under the authority of the Court of Audit was appointed at the Department to monitor the bookkeeping operations and to

ARCHIVES 1. ARCHIVAL HISTORY Throughout the operational period of the Department for Economic Recovery, its archives remained in the premises of the Department located Boulevard Anspach 3 in Brussels, where they were preserved integrally.24 When a shutdown of the activities of the DER loomed, things became more complicated. The central file preserved at the National Archives of Belgium (NAB) clearly shows that the DER already had contacts with the NAB in 1966. In this year, former National Archivist Marie-Rose Desmed-Thielemans made an inspection visit to the DER after which Mr. Rossignol, then DER director, was allowed to destroy a number of archive series and to transfer others to the State Archives in Beveren-Waas (see below). The correspondence from the first half of the 1990s indicates that parts of the archives regarding the recovery of stolen pieces of art were brought to the Royal Institute for Art Heritage in 1979 by Mr. Rossignol, then still active former collaborator of the Belgian Office for Economy and Agriculture. Upon suggestion of Mr. Jacques Lust, former collaborator at the Office, these archives were brought back in the custody of the DER’s legal successor in 1993-1994.25 2. ACQUISITION The archives of the DER currently preserved at the National Archives and subject of this inventory, were initially composed of six separate archive blocks transferred to the National Archives at different points in time. The first transfer probably took place in 1966,26 when a number of archive series were brought to the State Archives in Beveren-Waas after the visit of former National Archivist Marie-Rose Desmed-Thielemans to the DER. These were files pertaining to the recovery of ships and cargo, documentation files about the Schuman plan and the statutes of the coal mines, the file card boxes about the support measures for the Belgian flax industry and the files about the trade relations with Turkey and East Germany, altogether summing up to 8 linear metres. Later, probably in the early 1980s, this sub-series was brought to the National Archives. The history behind the acquisition of two of the six archive blocks that came to the National Archives cannot be traced back in detail due to gaps in the central file. These two blocks are on the one hand a sub-series of roughly six linear metres, mainly minutes of the DER and its legal successor in folders and files, and on the other hand a smaller sub-series of about 2 linear metres from the Sequestration Office, composed of minutes filed in dossiers, and financial reports with annexes. Both archives were supposedly transferred in the 1990s. The next archives transfer took place in early 2004, when an archives repository of the Federal Public Service (FPS) Economy located rue de Belgrade no. 15 in Forest (Brussels) had to be cleared out. Already in 2001, the authorities had decided to withdraw from the                                                 

 23 Decree-law of 16 December 1946, Art. 7-8 (Belgian Official Journal, 22/12/1946). 24 The legal predecessor of the DER, the Department for Identification and Liquidation, was established Hertogsstraat/Rue du Duc no. 33 in Brussels during the years of war. 25 The correspondence in question was inspected by today’s Mission Restitution Cultural Goods of the FPS Economy in February 2012. 26 The exact transfer date could not be determined, but it is believed to have taken place in 1966 already, because the files had no more administrative value, neither for the DER nor for its legal successor.  




Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   19rental agreement for the building in Forest for budgetary reasons. After inquiring at the FPS Economy, SMEs, Self-Employed and Energy about the administrative value of the archive, a team of the National Archives carried out a selection in 2003. Exactly 110 workdays later, in February 2004, the emergency operation was rounded off. A total of 658 linear metres of files from 54 different institutions were retrieved from an initial 3500 metres of archives from the Forest repository and transferred to the National Archives.27 Among these files was a small archive with minutes from the management board of the DER, addressed at the time to one of the council members from the Ministry for Economic Affairs. In early 2006, a small archive of approximately 2 linear metres from the Ministry of Finance was acquired under the supervision of National Archivist Luc Vandeweyer. This archive was kept in a repository located at Quai de Willebroek in Brussels and primarily contained files with minutes and reports about German reparations and the re-equipment of the Belgian coal mines. The last phase of archives transfer took place in 2011, when a sub-fonds of some 7 linear metres was handed over by Mr. Bart Eeman, employee at the Mission Restitution Cultural Goods under the authority of the DG Economic Potential of the FPS Economy on 4 October. It concerned dossiers and documents form the office in charge of the recovery of stolen pieces of art within the Directorate for Recovery of the DER. The sub-fonds was “re-discovered” in September 2010. During talks with Mr. Bart Eeman of the Mission Restitution Cultural Goods, it appeared that the office was inclined to transfer this sub-fonds if a digital working copy of the documents was made internally. When this copy was finished in summer 2011, the actual and physical transfer could be prepared. The transfer itself was subject to an agreement between the National Archives and the FPS Economy, according to which the transferred archives would be inventoried within six months. Furthermore, the National Archives committed itself to providing a digital copy of the sorted and inventoried archive to the DG Economic Potential. The present inventory thus results from the consolidation of the six sub-fonds mentioned earlier. It can be argued that the three series of minutes from Finance and Economic Affairs (two of which were from Finance and one from Economic Affairs) do not, strictly speaking, belong to the reunited archive. According to the principle of provenance, it can be asserted that the series of minutes were intended for preservation by the council members of these different departments, as the documents were for their use. On the other hand, the persons involved received these documents in their capacity of council members of the DER. Further research into the archive documents has shown that they sometimes formed an addition to the series of minutes preserved by the secretariat of the DER and its legal successor: in some cases the minutes in the dossiers contain annexes that do not exist elsewhere. In order to avoid loss of information, and to bring the available documents together in one archive for convenience, it was decided to include relevant dossiers from Finance and Economic Affairs in this inventory. A reference of origin is indeed indicated on every one of the dossiers in question.28 Under these circumstances, the integration of the documents seems justified to us.

Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   20III. CONTENT AND STRUCTURE A. CONTENT The archives of the Department for Economic Recovery and its legal predecessor, the Department for Identification and Liquidation, forms a particularly rich archive for the study of social and economic history during the occupation and the post-war period. The DER was the sole competent authority for carrying out the post-war recovery policy and coordinating reparations. What makes the DER’s archives even more interesting with regard to its content is the “Gestalt switch”, the change of form that occurred in the 1950s: as the importance of recovering ships, commodities, industrial goods and pieces of art decreased, the DER got more and more involved in supporting the Belgian industry and foreign trade relations. The minutes of the management board of the DER often contain statistical data and reports as annexes and bear witness of this evolution. As far as the manner of working of the DER is concerned, the files and documents from the Directorate Recovery are of particular interest. The archive documents about the recovery of stolen pieces of art form a distinct sub-fonds. The state and identification files for the stolen artworks are, together with the dossiers about the recovery policy of the Belgian authorities, a particularly precious source for historical research. As the whereabouts of most stolen pieces of art have not yet been elucidated until today, the archive documents related to these unrecovered artworks still have a potential administrative value. The Directorate Recovery was also tasked with the recovery of ship cargo (during the occupation, this task was executed by the Department for Identification and Liquidation) and ships (files opened by the DER). The overviews and files of this part of the archive give insight into the relations between the DER and foreign authorities, among which the Allied Powers, the French authorities and later also the German authorities. The archival lot pertaining to the reparations provides a detailed view of the goods given to Belgium within the framework of the distribution of compensations among the Western Allies. This part contains annual reports and other records of the Belgian delegation to the Inter-Allied Reparations Agency (IARA) as well as inventories of German business companies and factories that were broken up to the advantage of Belgium. Finally, the part about government operations holds files and documents concerning the coordination or mediation role that the DER played in both the Belgian industrial sector (in particular the protection of the flax and mining industries) and foreign trade relations. With regard to the latter, the archive files provide details about the settlement of the outstanding debts towards Turkey, and import and export to East Germany. B. APPRAISAL AND DESTRUCTION Upon inventorying no documents were selected for destruction, but in two document series containing numerous doubles, some documents were sorted out: the series of minutes of the management board often contained up to three or four copies of minutes of proceedings, each one as comprehensive as the others. As this content is also comprised for the most part in the series of minute files, multiple copies could be sorted out generously without loss of information.29 The same was done with the series of identification forms for stolen pieces of art that the DER had recovered from the Service for the Protection of Cultural Heritage (Service pour la Protection du Patrimoine culturel) (see below) and that contained in average five to six copies of a form. As this series is also entirely preserved in handwriting and the                                                 

 29 See chapter about the acquisition of archives, p. 19-20. 




Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   21information from the forms is also present in other document series about stolen pieces of art, thorough sorting out took place here as well.30 In the process of inventorying it appeared that the DER had itself carried out little selections in file series originating from its legal predecessor: files on the recovery of particular ships, more precisely on matters that could be closed quickly and therefore no longer were of administrative use for the Department.31 The summary of matters dealt with shows the files in question. When the DER contacted the State Archives in 1966, it was also authorised to destroy some series, namely 1) files about advance payments to flax workers; 2) files on advance payments to coal mines within the framework of the re-equipment policy; 3) individual files regarding (coal) cargo and 4) a collection of official publications.32 The precise volume of these series is not mentioned. Their destruction supposedly took place shortly after the authorisation was given. Finally, a request for the destruction of archives was also filed in 1971 by the legal successor of the DER, i.e. the former Belgian Office for Economy and Agriculture. This request bore on a small amount of official documentation and bookkeeping documents for the most part. Correspondence states the volume of this series as being of “15 office cupboards and storage furnitures”.33 C. ACCRUALS Given that the Department for Economic Recovery was closed down almost half a century ago (the most recent archive documents date from March 1968) and its legal successor, the Belgian Office for Economy and Agriculture, also does no longer exists, additions to this archive can be excluded in principle. A number of shortcomings in the archive remain unsolved however. First of all, many personnel files of the former service and its legal predecessor are missing (family names starting with letters C-D and M-Z). Another important discovery is that there are no more traces of the recovery of lost or missing cargo from wagons in the archive: the second ten-year report of the DER states that the Department for Identification and Liquidation had set up a file card system with some 60,000 cards of goods on wagons.34 However, neither the file cards nor the main files about the recovery of cargo and rolling stock (opened by the Department for Identification and Liquidation or the DER) were ever found. This deficiency raises questions, especially when considering that the file card boxes and files about the recovery of ships and cargo have been preserved. Finally, the archive does not bear trace of the DER’s collaboration in the space programme of the European Launch Development Organisation (ELDO) and the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) either. D. SYSTEM OF ARRANGEMENT After due consideration, the necessity of sorting the different sub-fonds and documents of the Department for Economic Recovery and its legal predecessor became self-evident. It was decided not to separate the archive into two entities, i.e. into a document collection belonging to the Department for Identification and Liquidation and a collection of the Department for                                                 

 30 See inventory numbers 519-559. 31 See for instance inventory numbers 702-703. 32 Letter of 17 June 1966 to Mr. Rossignol, director of the DER.  33 Additional data can be found in the correspondence under inventory number 1127. 34 See ten-year work report for 1940-1949, p. 20 (inventory number 327). 




Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   22Economic Recovery (DER), because the amount of documents originating from the first one is rather limited and a number of matters it dealt with after the war were taken over by the DER. The DER thus made additions to the files of the Department for Identification and Liquidation. The indicated sorting is largely defined by the organisation chart of the DER. As the Department underwent several internal reshuffles in the course of the years, there was of course no question of subdividing the archival documents according to two or more time spans. However, a distinction could be made between the main “tasks” or bodies within the DER that carried out clearly defined missions. Consequently, a distinction was made between the administrative services (general documentation, human resources, bookkeeping and logistics), the management board (containing both the management board minutes (and annexes) of the Department for Identification and Liquidation and the Department for Economic Recovery) and the different directorates that were moulded into an organisational scheme based on responsibilities and duties. The Directorate Recovery seems to be the most important one. Within this directorate a distinction was made between the recovery of stolen artworks,35 the recovery of ships (and cargo) and finally the recovery of foreign exchanges. The second biggest service was the Directorate Reparations with a document series about the Belgian representation to the IARA, and another series on the national policy with regard to the allocated reparations. The third and last directorate was in charge of government operations and was subdivided into operations at home (Belgian coal and flax industry) and abroad (trade relations with East Germany and Turkey). Another section was provided for a limited number of files regarding the archive and documentation policy of the legal successor of the DER, namely the Belgian Office for Economy and Agriculture. Lastly, a very small number of documents remained with no specific or apparent connection to the archive: these were chiefly financial documents from the occupation period that were microfilmed during the immediate post-war period. IV. ACCESS AND USE A. PROVISIONS FOR ACCESS AND REPRODUCTION Archival records older than 30 years are public. Access to and reproduction of these documents are subject to the general rules and regulations in force at the State Archives. Exceptions to the general rule of publicity apply to documents that contain privacy related information. The law of 8 December 1992, amended by the law of 11 December 1998, concerning the protection of privacy implies a number of restrictions in this regard. In practice, restrictions apply to the personnel files under inventory numbers 8-129, the files about legal disputes under number 392-393 and numbers 397-399. This means that the documents to which these particular inventory numbers refer become publicly accessible only after 100 years. For the time being, they can thus only be accessed under the condition that a                                                 

 35 As appears from the table of contents, the archives  about the recovery of looted artworks also comprise a series on the restitution activities that took place from the 1990s onwards under the supervision of the Belgian Office for Economy and Agriculture. Given that the inventorying of the documents was subject to an agreement and had to be accomplished within six months after the transfer of the records (see above, p. 20), these documents could not be filed elsewhere due to a lack of time. As a clear distinction was made in the inventory between these more recent documents and other records and because inventorying took place within the framework of the same assignment, this classification decision does neither form, in my judgement, a breach of the principle of provenance nor an impediment to the structure of the inventory. 




Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   23research declaration is filled in at the reading room of the National Archives in Brussels. Inventory numbers 406 and 409 can only be accessed after 30 years. B. LANGUAGE AND SCRIPTS The archive documents are for the most part authored in Dutch or French. In general, the minutes of the DER’s management board and corresponding annexes are written in both languages, but this is not always the case when documents date from the early years. The archive of the Department for Identification and Liquidation is almost entirely in French. Also, some files contain documents in English (from the American or British Allied authorities) and in German (written by the German occupying power or the German post-war authorities). C. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS Nearly the entire archive of the Department for Economic Recovery and its legal predecessor consists of paper documents. But there are also a number of glass negatives and microfilms that had to be digitised due to their very fragile nature. More precisely, digital images were made of inventory numbers 366-369, 603-630 and 1131-1132 which can be accessed in the reading room of the National Archives. V. RELATED DOCUMENTS As the Department for Economic Recovery carried out a vast variety of tasks during almost a quarter of a century, related archival sources are legion. The following part is limited to the most important and relevant documents preserved at the State Archives, in other Belgian public institutions and abroad. 1. STATE ARCHIVES The archives on which the present inventory bears can be described as the general policy files of the DER and its legal predecessor, the Department for Identification and Liquidation. In addition to them, both bodies also opened files about individual recovery claims they handled. These files form a distinct archival fonds of some 120 linear metres that was inventoried in 2007 by state archivist François Antoine (Inventory no. I 400) and is today preserved at the National Archives 2 (Repository “Joseph Cuvelier”). The fonds comprises two file series (one main series and one “blue series”), dating from the early 1940s to the early 1960s and accessible via an alphabetical file card system (sorted according to the family names of all persons involved) contained in a metallic chest of drawers for the time being. Both series have shortcomings, mainly because of the fact that all files about persons who also filed a claim at the Office for War Damage (Dienst Oorlogsschade/Administration Dommages de Guerre) were transferred to this administration. This naturally leads us to the most important additional source, namely the archives from the Office for War Damage under the authority of the former Minister for Reconstruction (later Public Works). During the second half of the 1940s, the successive Belgian governments envisaged a vast legislation regarding the reparations for material damage incurred to private goods.36 The losses as a consequence of acts of war on Belgian national territory after 27                                                 

 36 The most relevant legal texts in this regard are the decree-law of 19 September 1945 about the declaration of damages to private goods suffered due to the war (Belgian Official Journal, 20/10/1945), the law of 1 October 




Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   24August 1939 were estimated to 35 billion Belgian Francs. In late 1948, a total of 697.392 reparation claims had already been filed at the Ministry for Reconstruction. Handling of all these cases led to the creation of a very voluminous file series comprised in over more than 20 kilometres of archives. The record card system that provides access to this archive and the files about the processing of reparation claims from Wallonia are currently already preserved at the National Archives 2. Another significant document series is the archive of the Brüsseler Treuhandgesellschaft (BTG), a company set up by the German Military Administration for the administration of “enemy” and “Jewish” goods. Upon its creation in October 1940, the BTG was initially tasked with detecting “enemy” and “Jewish” influences in the Belgian economy, later with the administration and liquidation of properties originating from such influences. The archive preserved at the National Archives in Brussels is composed of three parts: 1) the post-war management of the BTG, entrusted to a distinct Sequestration Office BTG directed by two delegates from December 1944; 2) the correspondence and file series created by the BTG itself during the occupation; 3) files and identification forms about “enemy” and “Jewish” business companies in Belgium authored by the Wirtschaftsabteilung of the German Military Administration, more precisely Gruppe XII, responsible for enemy and Jew assets. The three archive series comprise a total of 80 linear metres of documents. Completion of the definitive inventory for this archive is due for late 2013. The National Archives also preserve a bundle of letters and documents from Gaston Demeter, bookkeeper at the former Musée royal de peinture et de sculpture de Belgique in Brussels. This bundle holds a catalogue of artists and their works as well as correspondence with Leo Van Puyvelde, who became head curator of the Royal Musea for Fine Arts in autumn 1944. The bundled letters are part of the archive series “Acquisitions of Department III” (inventoried under number 738) and shed some light on the policy and administration with regard to pieces of art at the end of the occupation and during the subsequent post-war period. Detailed information about the Belgian post-war policy concerning the restitution of stolen pieces of art to Belgian musea is available for research in an archive folder of the joint services of the former Ministry for National Education and Culture. Although this archival fonds has not been inventoried to date, the file in question can be requested in the reading room of the National Archives via one of the archivists of section 5 (“Contemporary Archives”). The National Archives also preserves an approximately nine linear metres long un-inventoried archival fonds from the Belgian representation to the Inter-Allied Reparations Agency (IARA). The fonds was transferred in 2005 by the cadastre administration, i.e. the Registration and Domains Office of the FPS Finance. A detailed list of the contents of this archive exists, stating correspondence, reports and minutes of the general IARA council for the period 1945-1961. As far as the trade and government operations of the DER are concerned, the National Archives also holds an important archival fonds of the Inter-ministerial Economic Commission (IEC) from the period 1944-1991. This fonds (inventory no. I 348) stretches over some 120 linear metres and contains minutes of various commissions and work groups active within IEC and about 3000 alphabetical and thematic files on different topics related to diverse economic sectors and foreign trade relations.                                                                                                                                                         

 1947 about reparations (Belgian Official Journal, 10/10/1947) and the Royal decree of 30 January 1954 for the consolidation of the laws on reparations for damages to private goods (Belgian Official Journal, 19/02/1954). 




Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   252. OTHER PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS Beside the State Archives, other Belgian public institutions also preserve archival fonds or documents directly linked to the lootings that took place during the occupation and the restitution of public and private good in the post-war period. For instance: the archives of the Service for the Protection of Cultural Heritage under the authority of the former Ministry for Education that was initially charged with tracing and recovering stolen artworks. Leo van Puyvelde, former head curator of KMSK at Brussels, was also General Director of the service. The archive of less than half a metre is today still preserved by the Mission Restitution Cultural Goods under the authority of the FPS Economy, but shall be transferred to the National Archives in the course of 2013. A number of more voluminous archival fonds are preserved by the Directorate General War Victims (FPS Social Security) responsible for the execution of the legislation about civil victims of war; they contain files and file card systems regarding the “Möbelaktion”, the operation aimed at plundering unoccupied houses and apartments of Jews that started in January 1942 in Belgium. The DG War Victims also preserves a series of six files [R 123/Tr 148.282] containing an alphabetical overview of Jewish citizens living in the Brussels agglomeration who were victim of this operation. For the city of Liège too, the DG preserves a list of Jewish properties looted by the German occupant [R 497/Tr 181.926]. There is also a file card system stored in 27 boxes that contains data on the “Möbelaktion” carried out in Antwerp, Charleroi, Arlon and Leuven (Louvain). Finally, the DG War Victims also preserves a number of work reports of the Dienststelle Westen (in Belgium) of the Reichsministerium für die besetzten Ostgebiete that coordinated the “Möbelaktion”. Lastly, mention must be made of the archives of the Study Commission Jewish Assets (better known as Study Commission Buysse). This body was set up by the Chancellery of the Minister by the Royal Decree of 6 July 1997 and the law of 15 January 1999. Its aim was to investigate the fate of Jewish assets that were plundered or surrendered during the Second World. The Study Commission studied the ways in which looting took place during the occupation, as well as the measures taken after the war to restore the looted property to its owners or to pay compensation.37 The findings of the study commission were used by its legal successor, the Jewish community Indemnification Commission.38 The study commission has set up a database (called “Mala Zimetbaum”) containing information about every person who was victim of plundering during the occupation, regardless of their nationality. This database and the paper files and documents about the research carried out by the members of the study commission are still kept at the Chancellery of the Prime Minister today, but will probably be transferred to the National Archives in the course of 2014. 3. FOREIGN INSTITUTIONS In foreign countries too, relevant archival fonds and documents are preserved and international projects that could be of interest for researchers are launched, especially in the field of art theft during the Second World War.

The follow-up was carried out from 1 January 2008 by the services of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.

Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   26The Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit (NK) in the Netherlands was commissioned to recover artworks from abroad (chiefly from Germany) after the war and to handle recovery requests. Works of art whose proprietors could not be identified were sold at auction or placed under public administration, forming today’s NK-collection.39 The archives of the Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit are preserved by the Nationaal Archief in The Hague. In France, a similar approach was taken: artworks that were recovered but never claimed by their rightful owners were placed in the custody of the Directorate of French Museums.40 Also regarding France, one can mention the Jeu de Paume Project, an online database in which data (primarily from the Bundesarchiv) about stolen artworks is gathered. These archives were created by the “Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg” (ERR), one of the main taskforces of the Nazi regime dedicated to plundering cultural property and artworks in the occupied countries during the Second World War, that is to say among others, artworks of French and Belgian Jews that were brought to the Jeu de Paume building of the Tuileries Gardens in Paris between 1940 and 1944, where they were selected by the ERR Sonderstab Bildende Kunst. Today, there exists an illustrated database of the registration file cards and photographs taken by the ERR of some 20,000 pieces of art looted from France and, to a minor degree, Belgium. The database can be searched by the name of the piece of art or the former proprietor(s).41 Finally, the Joint International Project on Records Relating to Nazi-Era Cultural Property under the supervision of the National Archives of the United States is a research portal site with links to records, inventories and digital images of archival documents about the plundering of artworks and cultural property. In May 2011, the Belgian State Archives has officially joined the project as partner institution.42 B. PUBLICATIONS 1. PRINTED SOURCES Belgisch Staatsblad/Moniteur Belge, Brussels, 1940-1970.

DESCRIPTION CONTROL Inventorying the records of the DER and of its legal successor was a long work process. In august 2009 already, I started with the selection, description and packaging of the different series of minutes from the management board of the DER. The next step took place in September 2010, when I contacted Mr. Bart Eeman of the Mission Restitution Cultural Goods under the authority of the FPS Economy. After the transfer of the DER’s archival fonds regarding the recovery of looted artworks in early October 2011, the final phase of inventorying was begun. From mid-December 2011 until early May 2012, I described and packaged all remaining archival documents. According to the transfer agreement that the National Archives had concluded, the description, sorting and conditioning of the documents related to looted artworks were given priority. Pascale Bataille, a collaborator of Section 5 (“Contemporary Archives”) got involved in the packaging and numbering of some thousands of identification forms about looted artworks (inventory numbers 413-518). Once this work was finished, the documents were digitised in-house. On 15 May 2012, the draft version of the present inventory was submitted to the Head of Section and the Head of Department for approval. The English version of the inventory was published in May 2013. Filip Strubbe

33  INVENTORY I. ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES The structures and subdivisions of the DER’s general services, just as those of the directorates, were often subject to internal adjustments – at least according to the organisation charts. Such changes had of course very little or no impact at all on the functioning of the general secretariat, human resources, bookkeeping and the supplies service (economaat/économat). The management board appointed the agents and the personnel of the DER and could determine their statutes. In 1947, the DER reached its highest personnel number, that is to say 420. The reduction of the tasks concerning recovery and reparations in the immediate post-war period brought about a significant decline in the number of personnel. In 1959, the DER counted only 43 personnel members. A. GENERAL 1.

MANAGEMENT BOARD Day-to-day management of the DIV/OIL was initially taken care of by a governing committee composed of one chairman and five to seven members. From March 1942 on, the composition changed and henceforth 12 to 15 members were part of the committee. The organisational structure of the DER was largely based on the DIV/OIL’s structure, yet the old government committee was immediately replaced by a management board composed of 5 to 7 members. The decree-law of 16 December 1946 brought a number of changes to the structure of the management board: henceforth, the board had to count at least 9 including one representative of respectively the Prime Minister, the Minister for Economic Affairs, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister for the Re-equipment of the Country and the Sequestration Office.

DIRECTORATE RECOVERY The coordination of Belgium’s post-war restitution policy forms the basis for the creation of the DER. It is thus no coincidence that this aspect induced the major part of the archive creation process. The enormous amounts of raw materials, products, machines, stocks, currencies and artworks that were lost or looted due to the war had to be traced and brought back to Belgium. The basic principles of the right to restitution were established at the Paris Peace Conference (December 1945) about reparations: Restitutions were limited to identifiable goods that were taken from an Allied country by force or without payment during the occupation. The Allied Control Council in Berlin defined the general rules according to which Germany had to carry out the restitution decisions, while the commanders of the different occupation zones decided on the procedure to follow. From September 1949, the Allied Control Council ceased almost all activities and Germany was re-empowered with parts of its national sovereignty. As a consequence, the recovery question progressively had to make place for economic issues. On 26 May 1952, the Settlement Convention was signed in Bonn to establish the cornerstones for further restitution regulations. A. RECOVERY OF LOOTED ARTWORKS The procedure for the recovery of cultural goods was for the most part identical to the one used for economic goods. Yet, the Belgian recovery actions turned out to be difficult due to insufficient insight into the full scope of artworks looting committed by the German occupant and the late resort to specialised investigators. Initially, the Service pour la protection du patrimoine culturel under the supervision of Leo van Puyvelde was the sole authority in charge of the recovery of looted artworks, but at the end of 1945, this mission was entrusted to the DER. As the archival documents show (see inventory number 363), the relationship between both administrations was, to say the least, troubled. The same was true regarding the contacts between the culture office of the DER and the other Belgian administrations: relevant archives from German public authorities concerning looting of artworks in Belgium ended up at various public authorities (administrations ranging from the Sequestration Office to the Military Prosecutor’s Office) that did not communicate sufficiently among each other. Consequently, the restitution policy was deprived of its essence: Belgium only received 1,155 cultural goods from the Allied zones in Germany and Austria, compared to 30,207 goods for France and 6,891 goods for the Netherlands. Also, the DER had little interest in tracing looted archives or libraries (of which only 20% were recovered) and was more focussed on the recovery of plastic artworks as they appeared to have more prestige and could be identified more easily. Once 




Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   49brought back to Belgium, the cultural goods could be restituted to their rightful owners, but the majority of them were ceded to Belgian cultural institutions or sold by auction for the benefit of the national treasury. All in all, some 90% of the recovered artworks were regained for the benefit of the Belgian state: 639 paintings and archaeological artefacts were handed over against payment to 15 Belgian musea and cultural institutions, while a few thousands of unidentified cultural goods were sold by public auction between 1946 and 1954 or traded by the DER and the Land Registration and Estates Department (Administratie van Registratie en Domeinen/Administration de l’enregistrement et des domains) in Brussels. From 1956 to 1962, the DER also maintained contacts with the German Bundesamt für Äußere Restitutionen, which produced no more tangible results however. 1. COORDINATION OF THE RESTITUTION POLICY a.

RECOVERY OF SHIPS AND CARGO As a consequence of the warfare, much cargo disappeared from (steam) ships after 1940, which the DIV/OIL tried to find back in order to restitute these goods to their rightful owners. After the occupation, the DER was charged with an additional task that comprised the identification and restitution not only of missing cargo, but also of ships claimed by the “Kriegsmarine” or constructed under constraint. In case a ship was found back in Germany, negotiations had to be started with the Allied authorities about a possible repair of the vessel, depending on its state, in order to restore its floating capacity and make it seaworthy again (at the cost of the German economy), or about selling the wreck or heavily damaged inland navigation vessel if its recovery was not necessary. In 1945, the DER recovered 131 inland navigation vessels, and an additional 126 in 1946.

Archives of the Department for Economic Recovery Inventory number: 21   73IV. DIRECTORATE REPARATIONS Already during the Yalta Conference in early 1945, the Allied forces decided to claim reparations from Germany to be drawn from its economy in order to finance the reconstruction of the war-ravaged countries and to disable Germany’s warfare potential. The final agreement of the Paris Peace Conference established the principles distributing reparations among the 18 Allied beneficiary countries according to the damage their respective economies have suffered and to their respective contributions to the Allied war effort. The Inter-Allied Reparations Agency (IARA) was charged with the actual distribution among these countries of the available goods that could serve as reparations. Belgium received 6,7% of the total value of goods suitable for reparations. The DER organised missions to Germany, carried out field investigations and then communicated its conclusions to the Belgian delegation to the IARA. Once the Allied authorities gave their approval, the DER took care of the dismantling and transport of the allocated goods. Belgium received 211 plants of the heavy metals, chemical, coal and textile industries, that yielded a total financial compensation of roughly 567 million Belgian Francs. A.

DIRECTORATE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS From the mid-1950s, the Ministry for Economic Affairs also charged the DER with purely economic and commercial missions. With the DER, the former ministers hoped to have a versatile work instrument at their disposal that could handle the state’s supervision of economic transactions in order to relieve the ministerial departments. Thanks to its expertise gathered throughout the years with regard to recuperation, coordination of reparations and trade with Germany, the DER was particularly qualified for commercial activities within an international environment in which economic activity was still coping with uncertainty. A. DOMESTIC MARKET In the national economy, the DER was active in those sectors that provided serious economic boom perspectives in the late 1950s, such as the Belgian coal and textile industry. As the amount of extracted coal steadily increased, it was decided to aid the mining companies by simplifying the warranting of the coal. Financing by banks was ensured by establishing the coal mines as bailees of commodities that served as a sort of non-moving guarantee: the DER supervised the warrant, the value and volume of the pawned coal stock. Concerning the Belgian textile industry, in particular the flax industry, the DER was entitled to make conditional advance payments (allocated by the council of Ministers) in form of bonuses for flax firms that produced spinnable flax filaments. 1.

FOREIGN RELATIONS The DER came into action as a negotiation and coordination authority in international economic relations when bilateral trade failed to run smoothly. This was among others the case in the mid-1950s, when the trade balances and financial relations between the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union and Turkey deteriorated to the disadvantage of the latter. The DER was charged with the supervision of the trade transactions with Turkey in order to channel the outstanding debt claims on this country (due to high prices in Turkey) by stimulating barter trade between Belgium and Turkey. One means to do so was to allocate bonuses to importers of Turkish products and to grant back-payments in priority to Belgian debtees against a specific percentage on the debt claim. The DER played a similar mediation role in 1958, when the trade relations between Belgium and the German Democratic Republic (not officially recognised by our country) threatened to come to a standstill. The Department led negotiations and carried out supervision of the (observance of) trade regulations and agreements regarding the exchange of goods between the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) and the German Democratic Republic from 1959 to 1960. 1.
