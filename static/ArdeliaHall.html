  <p>As the Nazis took over Europe in WWII, they looted everything from major
artwork pieces from national museums to ceremonial and personal items from the
Jewish people. The Ardelia Hall is a record collection of these recovered items
and the work to restore these stolen items to their proper owners. This is one
of the most popular collections at the National Archives and provides a
different picture of the Holocaust that many may not know about.</p>
