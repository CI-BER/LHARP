  <p>On 16 November 1944, shortly after the liberation of the Belgian national
  territory, the Belgian authorities set up the Department for Economic Recovery
  (DER)/Office de Récupération Economique (ORE) under the former Ministry of
  Economic Affairs. From its creation until its dissolution in 1968, the DER was
  the sole Belgian office responsible for tracing, recovering and liquidating
  lost movable goods of Belgian private or public possession in Belgium or
  abroad during the Second World War. As such, the DER was assigned with the
  tracing of enemy military equipment and responsible for war reparations by
  means of industrial compensations in kind, as well as the recovery and
  restitution of Belgian properties, including cultural goods. In light of the
  latter task, the DER included a culture office that was commissioned to
  identify and restitute stolen works of art. This resulted in the creation of
  various interesting record series on stolen artworks, including declaration
  forms, various files, file cards and a collection of photographs and glass
  negatives. The State Archives in Belgium conserve the "General Files" of the
  post-World War II service for the recovery of artworks, which was part of the
  DER. These records, which can be found under inventory numbers 362-632, are
  primarily in French and/or Dutch, and include a few records in English.</p>

  <p>The documents on the registration and recovery of looted art, which
  constitute a specific section within the "General Files," were digitized in
  2012. The digital images have been linked to the existing inventory
  descriptions, which are currently available on the State Archives' intranet.
  Researchers are required to inform the personnel of the National Archives (the
  State Archives' repository in the Brussels region) in advance and direct their
  inquiries before an appointment in the reading room can be made.
  <a target="_blank" href="http://arch.arch.be/%7Btaal%7D/component/option,com_rab_instellingen/task,view/id,1/Itemid,176/">Instructions
  for making such arrangements can be found online.</a></p>

  <p>Apart from its General Files, the DER also opened files about individual
  recovery claims that were handled. These files form a distinct archival fond
  of 120 linear metres, comprising two series dating from the 1940s to the early
  1960s. The files concerning individual recovery claims from the DER have also
  been inventoried (this search instrument has been incorporated in the
  sub-series "National Archives of Belgium," as inventory I 400). The inventory
  is not accessible online yet, but even so, all research for individual names
  must be performed via the former institute's alphabetical file card system
  (sorted according to the family names of all persons who made claims). Such
  preliminary research must be performed by the personnel working at the
  National Archives of Belgium 2 ("Cuvelier repository"). In practice,
  <a target="_blank" href="http://arch.arch.be/%7Btaal%7D/component/option,com_rab_instellingen/task,view/id,996/Itemid,176/">requests
  for information are to be directed here</a>.</p>

  <p>Because of the fact that all DER files about persons who also filed a claim
  at the Office for War Damage (Administration Dommages de Guerre) were
  transferred to the latter administration, the very voluminous archives from
  the Office for War Damage (under the authority of the former Minister for
  Reconstruction, later Public Works) will undoubtedly contain more information
  on looted or lost artworks. Handling of the reparation claims for material
  damage incurred to private goods led to the creation of a huge file series, 10
  kilometres of which has been conserved. Access to the file series of the
  Office for War Damage requires navigating through a complex record card
  system. Since the archives consist of a central series as well as nine
  provincial series, one can perform a double search based on the geographical
  location of the property or the former owner's residence (for each separate
  province, the file cards are alphabetically classified by town/municipality).
  Each file card contains a unique reference number pointing to a file. All
  preliminary research must be performed by the personnel working at the
  National Archives of Belgium 2 ("Cuvelier repository").
