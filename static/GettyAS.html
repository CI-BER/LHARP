  <p>The Getty Provenance IndexÂ® Databases provide online access to German Sales
Catalogs from German-speaking countries -- Austria, Germany and Switzerland --
from 1930 to 1945. More than 250,000 individual auction sales records for
paintings, sculptures and drawings are searchable by a range of parameters
including artist name and nationality, type of subject matter, lot title, buyer
or seller's name and the city in which the sale occurred. Each record in the
Provenance Index is linked to the full PDF of its corresponding catalog residing
at the website of Heidelberg University Library. The Databases also contain
bibliographic information on ca. 3,000 catalogs including the physical location
of copies with handwritten annotations.</p>
