  <p>The British records available through this portal are held by The National
  Archives in London, the repository since Domesday of all British government
  documentation. They represent records from all government departments involved
  in countering the Nazi spoliation of Europe and in resolving restitution and
  reparation claims arising after the war.</p>

  <p>The records highlight the wartime policy initiatives taken by the British
  government including the Inter-Allied Declaration against Acts of
  Dispossession Committed in Territories under Enemy Occupation and Control,
  issued in London on 5 January 1943, and the establishment of the Vaucher
  Commission in April 1944 and the Macmillan Committee in May 1944.</p>

  <p>Both during and after the war, the UK committed efforts and resources to
  establish collecting points and restitution commissions in Europe and effected
  the return of looted property to countries across Europe.</p>

  <p>Documents range from policy proposals to forms submitted by claimants seeking
  post-war restitution, as well as photographs of missing works of art and lists
  of individuals involved in the looting and damaging of cultural property. One
  of the distinctive features of this collection is the focus on losses from
  both public and private collections in countries such as Belgium, France,
  Hungary, Italy, Malta, The Netherlands and Yugoslavia.</p>
