  <p>The records made available on the Portal from the U.S. National Archives
(NARA) include over 2.3 million pages of documents created or received by the
U.S. Government during and after World War II as part of its investigations into
cultural assets that were looted or otherwise lost during the war. All of the
records have been described in NARA's online catalog. Many of the records have
additionally been digitized and made available for free online by our partner
Fold3.com (Holocaust Era Assets records ). The records are primarily in English,
although some seized records are in German or other languages. There are no
privacy or other access restrictions on the records.</p>
  <p>The sections below direct the user to the National Archives online catalog,
which provides both a description of each corresponding series of records and a
URL in the online resource section for the digitized records on Fold3. The
additional links that accompany each image direct the user to the
microfilm/digital publication pamphlet as well as to the digitized records
either on Fold3 or in NARA's online catalog.</p>

  <div id="ArdeliaHall">
  <p class="brief">As the Nazis took over Europe in WWII, they looted everything from major
artwork pieces from national museums to ceremonial and personal items from the
Jewish people. The Ardelia Hall is a record collection of these recovered items
and the work to restore these stolen items to their proper owners. This is one
of the most popular collections at the National Archives and provides a
different picture of the Holocaust that many may not know about.</p>
