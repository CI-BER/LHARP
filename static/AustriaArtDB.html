  <p>The Art Database of the National Fund provides information on art and
  cultural objects presently located in museums and collections of the Republic
  of Austria or of the City of Vienna, which, according to latest provenance
  research, may have been seized under the National Socialist regime. Their
  publication in this database takes place in co-operation with the Federal
  museums and collections concerned and with other Austrian institutions
  conducting provenance research and aims to determine whether there is a
  possibility of restituting these objects.</p>

  <p>Restitution reports of the Federation (1998-present) and restitution reports
  of the City of Vienna (2002-present) are available on the website of the Art
  Databases <a href="http://www.kunstrestitution.at/Reports_2.html">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Recommendations of the meetings of the Art Restitution Advisory Board
  (2009-present) are available on the website of the Art Databases <a
