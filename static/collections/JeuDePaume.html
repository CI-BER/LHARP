  <p>The Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR), the "Special Task Force" headed
by Adolf Hitler's leading ideologue Alfred Rosenberg, was one of the main Nazi
agencies engaged in the plunder of cultural valuables in Nazi-occupied countries
during the Second World War. A particularly notorious operation by the ERR was
the plunder of art from French Jewish and a number of Belgian Jewish collections
from 1940 to 1944 that were brought to the Jeu de Paume building in the
Tuileries Gardens in Paris for processing by the ERR Sonderstab Bildende Kunst
or "Special Staff for Pictorial Art."</p>

  <p>The Database of Art Objects at the Jeu de Paume is a joint project of the
  Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany and the United States
  Holocaust Memorial Museum.  This database brings together for the first time
  in searchable illustrated form the remaining registration cards and
  photographs produced by the ERR covering more than 20,000 art objects taken
  from Jews in German-occupied France and, to a lesser extent, in Belgium.
  Searchable by individual objects and by the owners from whom these objects
  were taken, the database is a detailed record of a small but important part of
  the vast seizure of cultural property that was integral to the Holocaust.</p>
