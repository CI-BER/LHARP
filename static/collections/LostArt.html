  <p>The Lost Art Internet Database contains data on cultural objects which as a
result of Nazi persecution or the direct consequences of the Second World War
were removed and relocated, stored or seized from their owners, particularly
Jews, or on cultural objects where, because of gaps in their provenance, such a
story of loss cannot be ruled out as a possibility. The database is divided into two areas:</p>

<h3>Search Requests</h3>
It is possible here to register cultural objects lost by public institutions or
private individuals and institutions as a result of National Socialist rule and
the Second World War, requesting a world-wide search via the Lost Art Internet
Database. Owners or custodians of cultural objects with an uncertain or
incomplete provenance can search here whether these objects have been sought
elsewhere.

<h3>Found-Object Reports</h3>
It is possible here to register cultural objects where it is known that they
were taken illegally from their owners or relocated to another place as a result
of the war. The section also contains reports on cultural items with an
uncertain or incomplete provenance, suggesting the possibility of illegal
dispossession or a removal and relocation due to the war. Institutions and
individuals who have suffered such a loss can search whether the cultural
objects they are looking for are contained in the list of found objects.
